Otherwise, we will assume that you are taking the risk of receiving melted chocolate.</p>

								<h4>What is a Bon?</h4>
								<div class="content">
									<p>Bon Bon Bons are “good goodies,” which essentially means that they can be made up of whatever sweet little concoctions we can dream up! This gives us the opportunity to come up with Bons using lots of local ingredients, some very far-away ingredients and a little artistic interpretation to create flavors that range from classic to bizarre, familiar to exotic, all-candy to all-chocolate. They're fun, can you tell? They're delicious, too!</p>

									<div class="clear"></div>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>What's up with your packaging?</h4>
								<div class="content">
									<p>"Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get" to us, is a problem that seems so easy to fix! Bon Bon Bons, or "Bons" as they're called on the street here in Detroit, are labelled, so you always know what you are going to get! The boxes are built to order which means you never need to guess how many are in a pound and we will never force you to fill a 12-piece box when all you wanted was eight! The packaging itself is 100% curbside recyclable and sources from less than a mile away from our little manufactory!</p>
									<div class="clear"></div>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>How do I open the Box?</h4>
								<div class="content">
									<p>Carefully! Kidding... First, lay the Box Box Box on a flat surface, Bon Bon Bon side up! Then, slit through the black and white "BON" tape on the far left and far right of you! You’re almost there. Now, remove the rubber band carefully....and....Voila! You should see a line of Bons down the center of the box, each labelled and ready to eat! When you are opening the little orange box, think of a finger trap! What you want to do is leave the sticker on and pull out the "flaps" on each side. When each flap is folded down, stick your finger through to push the Bon out one of the sides!</p>

								<h4>Who are "The Babes Babes Babes"?</h4>
								<div class="content">
									<p>The Babes Babes Babes are a group of hyper-diverse (mostly) women (sorry, Alex G.) who are united by their dedication to creativity, chocolate and community! Some of us are shy, some are outgoing, we're all a bit sassy and all a bit snuggly. Other than that we could not be more different, and we aim to keep it that way! It keeps us creative, and constantly facing new experiences. Together we can do anything.</p>
									<div class="clear"></div>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>How do you invent new flavors?</h4>
								<div class="content">
									<p>We don't totally know! But we like to do it... every day, really! If anyone is looking to do some academic research on innovation in a small company, we'd be curious to hear you tell us how this magical process is actually working! Teach us! We love learning! <a href="mailto:bonbonbon@bonbonbon.com">bonbonbon@bonbonbon.com</a></p>

								<h4>How does Bon Bon Bon manage allergies?</h4>
								<div class="content">
									<p>We produce all of our Bons in a little tiny manufactory that handles nuts, wheat, soy, dairy, eggs, honey, shellfish, and meat. Please note that we are able to avoid these items when we’re made aware of certain allergies. We cannot however, guarantee that any of our Bons are completely free from any of the items listed above. We don't want to hurt you! Ever! So, if you have a severe or life threatening allergy, please refrain from eating Bons. </p>
									<div class="clear"></div>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>Can I include a note with my order if itʼs a gift?</h4>
								<div class="content">
									<p>Of course! While in store, ask us for a note stamp on your box. We also have gift cards made by local artists available for purchase. Let us know how we can make it special! We live for this stuff...</p>
									<div class="clear"></div>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>How long do bons last?</h4>
								<div class="content">
									<p>Each bon is packaged in its very own box with a suggested expiration date. Bons last anywhere from 5 days to three weeks, depending on the flavor. We can help you build a box that best suits your needs. The way that you store your Bons will contribute to the actual expiration date of the Bons themselves! For example, if you leave the box open on the counter, the Bons don't usually make it to their expiration date... (&lt;-- get it? Because you eat them all...) </p>

								<h4>Can I place a larger order for an event?</h4>
								<div class="content">
									<p>You certainly can! We love events and making custom bons that fit your vision! See our Events &amp; Large Orders page for more detailed information. Please email <a href="mailto:bonbonbon@bonbonbon.com">bonbonbon@bonbonbon.com</a> to inquire.</p>
